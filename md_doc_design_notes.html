Caching</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Classes involved</h2>
<p>The term can mean a few different things. There are essentially 3 layers of what could be called "caching" at play here.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Immediate object storage<ul>
<li>These are in-memory collections of parsed, conveniently-laid-out objects written for-purpose</li>
<li>There are 2:<ol type="a">
<li><code>BlockStorage</code> contains the most recently-accessed blocks (as <code><a class="el" href="classipfs_1_1PbDag.html" title="Something to which a CID may refer directly.">ipfs::PbDag</a></code>), and a mapping of CID string representation[^1] to them.<ul>
<li>When a new entry is being saved, it may overwrite an existing entry if that one hasn't been accessed for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>If there's no stale entry convenient, it may instead expand memory usage and create an entirely new entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>IpnsNames</code><ul>
<li>Actually conflates 2 types of 'names' - DNSLink hostnames (without the _dnslink. prefix) and IPNS keys</li>
<li>Stores a mapping from name to a partial IPNS record, or in the case of DNSLink simply a CID</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Serialized cache, via <code>CacheRequestor</code><ul>
<li>This is using Chromium's <code>disk_cache</code> mechanisms to store blocks of bytes.</li>
<li>Note: this is ITS OWN instance. This is not http cache, nor bytecode cache, nor font cache, etc..</li>
<li>Both IPFS blocks and IPNS names are stored in the same caches.</li>
<li>The keys are the same as for the immediate object storage, the values are serialized forms in one channel, HTTP headers in the other</li>
<li>There are 2 instantiations:<ol type="a">
<li>A memory-only cache</li>
<li>An on-disk cache (directory name <code>IpfsBlockCache</code>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
Process</h2>
<p>The APIs are generally async, in a couple cases by necessity and in other cases to not overly complicate things.</p>
<p>To "get" a block or resolve an IPNS name:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Check the appropriate immediate object storage<ul>
<li>This part is actually synchronous, essentially just doing a hash map lookup</li>
<li>If it's there, great continue with logic. If not...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Request" it from ChainedRequestor<ul>
<li>Think of this as short-circuit logic like logical-or operators</li>
<li>The first step is to check the in-memory logic. If it's there:<ul>
<li>It get entered into immediate object storage</li>
<li>A callback of sorts happens to restart the process back at 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next check is on-disk cache<ul>
<li>If it's there, it gets written into memory cache AND immediate storage</li>
<li>The same callback mechanism is used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next after THAT is sending it over to the scheduler to issue network requests to gateways. If it gets found<ul>
<li>It gets written into all 3 levels</li>
<li>Other requests get cancelled</li>
<li>The very same callback mechanism occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
Expiration</h2>
<ul>
<li>IPFS blocks never expire, as they are immutable. They can be evicted for lack of use, though the rules for that differ by type of cache.</li>
<li>DNSLink resolutions expire after 5 minutes.</li>
<li>IPNS records expire at the time specified in the record, or time-received + TTL whichever comes later.<ul>
<li>Curious side note, an entry is not removed from caches <em>when</em> it expires. It's "doomed" when someone tries to access an already-expired entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md32"></a>
Scoring</h1>
<p>This is meant to document how gateway scoring is done in ipfs-chromium <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> meant to imply that it's the best approach, or that we will maintain it this way long-term.</p>
<p>Each gateway has an associated score, used to determine preference for sending requests there and also how many requests should be sent concurrently.</p>
<p>It's an unsigned integer in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A canonical score.<ul>
<li>It begins as a hand-written, hard-coded constant.</li>
<li>When a gateway successfully returns a useful result before cancellation, its score increases by 1.</li>
<li>If a gateway fails to return a useful response for any reason (timeout, doesn't support fetching IPNS records, etc.):<ul>
<li>If the score is already zero, the gateway is removed from the list entirely</li>
<li>Otherwise the score is decreased by 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having a request cancelled because some other gateway successfully returned a result for an identical request first does <em>not</em> alter the score.</li>
<li>These changes are intended to be persisted in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A temporary score<ul>
<li>When a top-level ipfs:// or ipns:// request begins, it fetches a (gateway request) scheduler<ul>
<li>If there is already a busy scheduler, it is re-used</li>
<li>If ipfs traffic is starting up from nil, instead a new scheduler is instantiated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a new scheduler is instantiate for this, it requests the list of gateways, with their scores.<ul>
<li>The scores retrieved are the canonical score <em>plus</em> a small non-negative random integer (geometric distribution tending toward zero)</li>
<li>This helps to ensure you won't always be sending requests to the same gateways in the same order, or in a deterministic way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When issuing a request to another gateway, it checks the gateways in descending-score order:</p><ul>
<li>If the gateway already has a request for that data startup_pending_, or has already failed to return successfully, it's skipped.</li>
<li>If the gateways score is less than the number of startup_pending_ requests currently sent to that gateway, it's skipped as it's considered already-too-busy</li>
<li>The "need" is generally calculated as the target number of gateways desired to be involved (based on request parallel), subtracting the number of gateways currently processing a request for this data.</li>
<li>If the "need" is less than half the count of startup_pending_ requests on this gateway, it's skipped as it's simply not urgent enough to justify further overloading this gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a side-note, the hard-coded starting points for the scoring effectively encodes known information about those gateways. For example: <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> is scored extremely highly. There's a good chance it has the resource you're looking for, and if it doesn't you may want to send a request that way anyhow so that it will in the future. Conversely, <a href="https://ipfs.anonymize.com/">https://ipfs.anonymize.com/</a> is rarely helpful and is barely hanging on at the bottom. <a href="https://jcsl.hopto.org/">https://jcsl.hopto.org/</a> is scored higher than one might imagine, given that it's not even commercially-hosted. But ipfs-chromium today is disproportionately used on the same set of test links, and jcsl.hopto will generally have those because it's John's home and his node.</p>
<p>[^1]: At some point this should be fixed. A difference in choice of multibase encoding or even codec should not cause a new entry. Different hash algos, on the other hand, are unavoidably incomparable. </p>
