# IPFS-Chromium updates: New Release, IPFS-Electron, Standardization

It's well past time to talk about things that have happened since the 
[last time](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-05-multigateway-chromium-client/) 
you heard about this project.

## IPFS-Chromium Version 0.0.1.2 Released

Recently we cut a new release of 
[IPFS-Chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/), 
which has some more steps along the way to being a practical approach to native multi-[trustless-gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/) support for `ipfs://` and `ipns://` URLs.

### Enhancements 

#### Feature-control switches 

For those who might consider dipping a toe rather than diving head-first.

* Chromium build flag ( `ENABLE_IPFS` ) so a codebase containing these changes can still be built without IPFS support, to ease adoption.
* A feature flag, ("Enable IPFS") so Chromium built with this (and the build flag on) can still have IPFS turned off with about://flags if the user wishes.

#### IPFS Features

There are features from some corners of the IPFS ecosystem not everyone needs,
naturally they did not get prioritized at first. 
Now we've implemented some more features, making things more complete.

* Handling [inline CIDs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/6c70fc240fb14f3022177af55f1dcbe1ab8f35c6/UNIXFS.md#deduplication-and-inlining) locally.
* [DAG-JSON](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-json/)
* [DAG-CBOR](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-cbor/)
* Support for [base-16](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase?tab=readme-ov-file#multibase-table) URLs and a fix for dealing with unsupported bases (no longer crashes the process).
* Handling of content root [_redirects](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/web-redirects-file/)
* Handling [UnixFS symbolic links](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/9131a7cfb56bf2ef4fb916feec53836c75ba1a05/src/unixfs-data-format.md#symlink-type)
* Preview page for a sharded directory that contains no index.html. It's ugly, but usable. Screenshots of the top and bottom of such a page, before "Load more" is clicked:

#### Gateway interaction improvements

* Using [delegated routing](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/#get-routing-v1-providers-cid) gateway API to discover additional gateways
* Partial ([dag-scope=entity](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#dag-scope-request-query-parameter)) CAR requests, for fetching multiple blocks in one round trip.
* Support for the environment variable [IPFS_GATEWAY](https://curl.se/docs/ipfs.html), though this project supports a superset: it's a whitespace-delimited list of gateways instead of just 1.
* Gateway rate (soft) limits persisted to user preferences
* Option to fallback to gateway for DNSLink-like roots. Helps when there's a DNS problem or if you need a resolver your system doesn't use but the gateway does, like ENS.

#### Browser features

* Some response headers for use in devtools, including some [Server-Timing](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/path-gateway/#server-timing-response-header) keys.
* Cache entries for IPNS records expire based on the date contained in the record
* Proper URL canonicalization for IPFS URLs (switching multibase) so that it surives lowercasing.
* Some user preferences where performance trades off against privacy concerns. 
  - Controlling whether the [Routing V1 API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is used to discover additional gateways
  - If so, are http:// (insecure) gateways included?
  - Whether DNSLink can fallback to gateway resolution when `DNSClient` is unavailable or unsuccessful (but requires trusting your gateways to resolve honestly)

### Dev & maintenance updates

The basics. They always gotta get done.

* Explicit licensing for ipfs-client (it's dual MIT/Apache)
* [Doxygen documentation](https://little-bear-labs.github.io/ipfs-chromium/)
* Various refactors in the ipfs-client library.
* Patches for new versions of Chromium.
* CI for library artifacts in releases (see ipfs-client* [here](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/latest))
* A bug fix in default URL escaping of ipfs::Client (not in Chromium)

## IPFS-Electron

![persianroomguardianinelectron](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJpxkfLlA.png)

While it may be [unlikely](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/41539) to get IPFS 
support in vanilla Electron by default, there are a number of use cases for slightly modified
[spins](https://littlebearlabs.io/perspectives/electron-spins-a-special-case-of-chromium-mods) on Electron, and if we get those 
[extension points](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42455) IPFS-enabled Electron could
be one.

And with that in mind, this repo now builds an IPFS-enabled electron as well, if you're using 
[this](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-electron) fork of Electron rather than the 
upstream where the extension points are not-yet-adopted. 

You can find some build artifacts 
[in the release](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/tag/0.0.1.2)
if you'd like to give it a try without building it yourself. 

_In particular, one could download the equivalent of_ `dist.zip`:
* [ipfs-ipfs-electron.linux.zip](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/download/0.0.1.2/ipfs-electron.linux.zip)
* [ipfs-ipfs-electron.win.zip](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/download/0.0.1.2/ipfs-electron.win.zip)
* [ipfs-ipfs-electron.mac.zip](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/download/0.0.1.2/ipfs-electron.mac.zip)
* [ipfs-electron.framework.mac.zip](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/download/0.0.1.2/ipfs-electron.framework.mac.zip)

## WICG Discussion

The very beginning of a discussion about standarizing IPFS functionality in browsers, 
of which this would be one implementation, is started over [here](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/143).

Naturally the suggestion isn't to adopt everything we've done here exactly as-is,
but to look for a reasonable subset of functionality that would give a good level of interoperability.
Feel free to read the [explainer](https://little-bear-labs.github.io/ipfs-chromium/md_doc_explainer.html)
on what we arrived at, and join in the discussion.

# Next Steps

The future is yet to be written. 
Where in the ecosystem would you like to see native support for multi-gateway IPFS clients? 
Feel free to comment on 
the [WICG ticket](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/143)
 for comment on web standardization, 
 the [Chromium ticket](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40909350), 
 the [Electron ticket](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42455), 
 or open an [issue on IPFS-Chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/issues) 
 for your own ideas & concerns.
