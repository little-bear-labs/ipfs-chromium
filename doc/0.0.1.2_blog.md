# IPFS-Chromium Version 0.0.1.2 Released

Recently we cut a new release of [IPFS-Chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/), 
so this is a good milestone to update on what's been going on since the [last time](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-05-multigateway-chromium-client/) 
we discussed this project.

## WICG Discussion

The very beginning of a discussion about standarizing IPFS functionality in browsers, 
of which this would be one implementation, is started over [here](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/143).

Naturally the suggestion isn't to adopt everything we've done here exactly as-is,
but to look for a reasonable subset of functionality that would give a good level of interoperability.
Feel free to read the [explainer](https://little-bear-labs.github.io/ipfs-chromium/md_doc_explainer.html)
on what we arrived at, and join in the discussion.

## IPFS-Electron

While it may be [unlikely](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/41539) to get IPFS 
support in vanilla Electron by default, there are a number of use cases for slightly modified
[spins](TODO - link to blog post) on Electron, and if we get those 
[extension points](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42455) IPFS-enabled Electron could
be one.

And with that in mind, this repo now builds an IPFS-enabled electron as well, if you're using 
[this](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-electron) fork of Electron rather than the 
upstream where the extension points are not-yet-adopted. You can find some build artifacts in the 
release if you'd like to give it a try without building it yourself.

## Enhancements 

As mentioned previously, this is an experimental proof-of-concept.
There are features from some corners of the IPFS ecosystem not everyone needs,
naturally they did not get prioritized at first. 
Now, we've implemented some of that, making things more complete.
Also, we've added conveniences that make adoption easier, 
and some considerations for the end user.

* Handling [inline CIDs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/6c70fc240fb14f3022177af55f1dcbe1ab8f35c6/UNIXFS.md#deduplication-and-inlining) locally.
* Using [delegated routing](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/#get-routing-v1-providers-cid) gateway API to discover additional gateways
* Support for the environment variable [IPFS_GATEWAY](https://curl.se/docs/ipfs.html), though this project supports a superset: it's a whitespace-delimited list of gateways instead of just 1.
* [DAG-JSON](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-json/)
* [DAG-CBOR](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-cbor/)
* Partial ([dag-scope=entity](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#dag-scope-request-query-parameter)) CAR requests, for fetching multiple blocks in one round trip.
* Support for [base-16](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase?tab=readme-ov-file#multibase-table) URLs and a fix for dealing with unsupported bases (no longer crashes the process).
* Handling of content root [_redirects](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/web-redirects-file/)
* Handling [UnixFS symbolic links](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/9131a7cfb56bf2ef4fb916feec53836c75ba1a05/src/unixfs-data-format.md#symlink-type)
* Some response headers for use in devtools, including some Server-Timing
* Chromium build flag, so a codebase containing these changes can still be built without IPFS support, to ease adoption.
* A feature flag, so Chromium built with this (and the build flag on) can still have IPFS turned off with about://flags if the user wishes.
* Cache entries for IPNS records expire based on the date contained in the record
* Proper URL canonicalization for IPFS URLs (switching multibase) so that it surives lowercasing.
* Gateway rate (soft) limits persisted to user preferences
* Some user preferences where performance trades off against privacy concerns.
* Preview page for a sharded directory that contains no index.html. It's ugly, but usable.
* Option to fallback to gateway for DNSLink-like roots. Helps when there's a DNS problem or if you need a resolver your system doesn't use but the gateway does, like ENS.

## Dev & maintenance updates

* CI for library artifacts in releases (see ipfs-client* [here](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/releases/latest))
* Patches for new versions of Chromium.
* Various refactors in the ipfs-client library.
* [Doxygen documentation](https://little-bear-labs.github.io/ipfs-chromium/)
* Explicit licensing for ipfs-client (it's dual MIT/Apache)
* A bug fix in default URL escaping of ipfs::Client (not in Chromium)
