<div class="textblock"><p>This is meant to document how gateway scoring is done in ipfs-chromium <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> meant to imply that it's the best approach, or that we will maintain it this way long-term.</p>
<p>Each gateway has an associated score, used to determine preference for sending requests there and also how many requests should be sent concurrently.</p>
<p>It's an unsigned integer in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A canonical score.<ul>
<li>It begins as a hand-written, hard-coded constant.</li>
<li>When a gateway successfully returns a useful result before cancellation, its score increases by 1.</li>
<li>If a gateway fails to return a useful response for any reason (timeout, doesn't support fetching IPNS records, etc.):<ul>
<li>If the score is already zero, the gateway is removed from the list entirely</li>
<li>Otherwise the score is decreased by 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having a request cancelled because some other gateway successfully returned a result for an identical request first does <em>not</em> alter the score.</li>
<li>These changes are intended to be persisted in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A temporary score<ul>
<li>When a top-level ipfs:// or ipns:// request begins, it fetches a (gateway request) scheduler<ul>
<li>If there is already a busy scheduler, it is re-used</li>
<li>If ipfs traffic is starting up from nil, instead a new scheduler is instantiated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a new scheduler is instantiate for this, it requests the list of gateways, with their scores.<ul>
<li>The scores retrieved are the canonical score <em>plus</em> a small non-negative random integer (geometric distribution tending toward zero)</li>
<li>This helps to ensure you won't always be sending requests to the same gateways in the same order, or in a deterministic way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When issuing a request to another gateway, it checks the gateways in descending-score order:</p><ul>
<li>If the gateway already has a request for that data pending, or has already failed to return successfully, it's skipped.</li>
<li>If the gateways score is less than the number of pending requests currently sent to that gateway, it's skipped as it's considered already-too-busy</li>
<li>The "need" is generally calculated as the target number of gateways desired to be involved (based on request priority), subtracting the number of gateways currently processing a request for this data.</li>
<li>If the "need" is less than half the count of pending requests on this gateway, it's skipped as it's simply not urgent enough to justify further overloading this gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a side-note, the hard-coded starting points for the scoring effectively encodes known information about those gateways. For example: <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> is scored extremely highly. There's a good chance it has the resource you're looking for, and if it doesn't you may want to send a request that way anyhow so that it will in the future. Conversely, <a href="https://ipfs.anonymize.com/">https://ipfs.anonymize.com/</a> is rarely helpful and is barely hanging on at the bottom. <a href="https://jcsl.hopto.org/">https://jcsl.hopto.org/</a> is scored higher than one might imagine, given that it's not even commercially-hosted. But ipfs-chromium today is disproportionately used on the same set of test links, and jcsl.hopto will generally have those because it's John's home and his node. </p>
